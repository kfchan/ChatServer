A chat server for my weeby.co application!

To join, run 'telnet 52.35.192.67 5555'.

Known Issues
- exiting chat server with the escape key instead of '/quit' doesnt remove 
  the name/socket from the socket hashMap until they leave telnet
- chat server doesn't remove users/sockets when they have been inactive or 
  when their terminal 'dies'
